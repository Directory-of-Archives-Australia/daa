<p>
Advance notice (by phone) of your research visit is required, so we can assess your document needs and arrange an appointment for you. Almost all original records are held offsite so we are unable to help people who 'just show up'. Prospective researchers are expected to visit the Archives pages on the City of Sydney website for more information about records held. Records which are less than seven years old are usually closed. Photocopying: A4 pages $1.00 each, A3 pages $2.00 each. 
</p>
</span>
","The Archives is responsible for managing all non-current records created by Sydney City Council since 1842 and most of its predecessor organisations since 1859. Some records created by elected officials are also held. We are also the archival agency for the Festival of Sydney Ltd. 
<p>
The Archives is also responsible for the Sydney Reference Collection of publications and semi-published material, and information folders containing ready-reference material, on aspects of Sydney City history especially the built environment. We actively seek material for inclusion in the Sydney Reference Collection and welcome donations.

","The JCPML is a specialist research and educational facility which houses primary source materials (originals and electronic). As Australia's first prime ministerial library, the JCPML's vision is to honour the contribution to Australia of its wartime leader and international statesman, John Curtin. The collection is actively being developed around those aspects of the history and politics of Australia that are most closely connected with the life and work of John Curtin. This provides a springboard for a range of other themes including the Australian-American relationship, post-war reconstruction, foreign policy, social and political history and the prime ministership as an office, including a focus on the lives and contribution of those directly associated with it such as the spouses and families of prime ministers. In line with the theme of the prime ministership as an office, Hazel Hawke's papers are lodged with the JCPML.

While the primary collection focus is on aspects of Australia's history and politics connected with the life and times of John Curtin, other records include the research papers of respected journalist and economist, Tom Fitzgerald, amassed for his intended biography of Curtin, the papers of Alex McCallum, WA State Labor parliamentarian and key associate of Curtin, and the papers of Bob Wurth connected to his research for his book ‘Saving Australia’. The JCPML also builds the collection by identifying journal articles, oral histories, theses, conference papers, etc of relevance to the collection themes and acquiring copies where appropriate.
